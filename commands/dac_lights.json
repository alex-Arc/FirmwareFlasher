  "description": "When \"dac_lights\" is set to 1, \"pulsed_lights_brightness\" and \"nonpulsed_lights_brightness\" settings will be interpreted by the device as 12-bit values (0 - 4095) directly controlling the LED voltage (via the DAC), instead of microEinsteins (uE).  This is used during factory calibration.\n\nNOTE! Setting brightness to high using raw DAC values could permanently disable LEDs, so be careful!",
