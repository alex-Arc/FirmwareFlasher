  "description": "\"environmental_array\" defines additional sensors or functionality, just like \"environmental\".  However, \"environmental_array\" returns sensor data once per pulse, as defined in \"pulses\".  This allows a string of sensor measurements to be used in a single macro.  The advantage is you can calculate and return in real time things like rates of change, minima and maxima, etc.  See examples for details.  NOTE!  \"pulsed_lights_brightness\" must NOT be set to zero for any given pulse set for the sensors set in \"environmental_array\" to measure.",
