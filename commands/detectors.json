  "description": "\"detectors\" defines which detectors are being measured, and in what order.  The chosen \"meas_light\" supplies the light source to be measured.  The detector measurement is recorded in \"data_raw\" in the data received from the MultispeQ, which is then graphed for the user.  When \"detectors\" is set to 0, no detector is read and responses will be recorded as zero.",
